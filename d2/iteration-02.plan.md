# Web Application for lifTOvers/Liftovers Team 2

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your initial planning meeting.     
 > It does not really make sense for you to edit this document much (if at all) while working on the project - Instead, at the end of the planning phase, you can refer back to this document and decide which parts of your plan you are happy with and which parts you would like to change.


## Iteration 02

 * Start date: November 01, 2019
 * End date: November 11, 2019

## Process

(Optional:) Quick introduction

#### Roles & responsibilities

Describe the different roles on the team and the responsibilities associated with each role. 
 * Roles should reflect the structure of your team and be appropriate for your project. Not necessarily one role to one team member.

List each team member and:
 * A description of their role(s) and responsibilities including the components they'll work on and non-software related work
 * 3 technical strengths and weaknesses each (e.g. languages, frameworks, libraries, development methodologies, etc.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We chose to have each team member in charge of an aspect of a project, and with that comes responsibilities to remind other team members about. All team members will be coding, and involved with every aspect, the following is simply a list of who is responsible for what aspect:
- UX/UI Design: Faye

#### Team Rules

Describe your team's working culture.

Communications:
 * What is the expected frequency? What methods/channels are appropriate? 
 * If you have a partner project, what is your process (in detail) for communicating with your partner?
 
Meetings:
 * How are people held accountable for attending meetings, completing action items? Is there a moderator or process?
 
Conflict Resolution:
 * List at least three team scenarios/conflicts you discussed in lecture and how you decided you will resolve them. Indecisions? Non-responsive team members? Any other scenarios you can think of?

**Communication**:   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We created a group chat on messenger to schedule team meetings which will happen every Friday at 3-5pm. If multiple members need clarification and help, we will set up group coding meetings in BA3200 so we can communicate face-to-face in order to resolve issues faster. If team members have questions about code, we will be using Slack, either through direct messaging or our team slack channel. We are also using Slack to communicate with lifTOvers for technical and functional questions. For technical questions, we will be directly messaging Abu, who is the technical lead of lifTOvers, and if we have questions about the product, we will be messaging the main slack channel. In order to come into contact with lifTOvers to set up meetings, Stacey is responsible for sending emails to them and corresponding. 
 
**Meetings**:   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set up an Agile Project on Github to keep track of tasks certain team members are responsible for and their progress. If a team member is struggling with their assigned task and notifies this problem to the team early, we can assign another team member to either assist or swap tasks with each other, so we meet our goals for the week. During meetings we will also have standups facilitated by the scrum master to report what we have completed and plan for the next sprint. Sprints will be 2 weeks in length. Team members are expected to attend weekly team meetings on Fridays from 3pm-5pm, as there are no class conflicts then. If there is an emergency and someone is unable to make it to the meeting, that person is expected to communicate their absence as soon as possible and prior to the meeting (by 12 hours if possible). Members will rotate taking notes during meetings for future reference, and if a member was unable to make it they are responsible for reviewing the meeting notes. 
 
**Conflict Resolutions**:    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-responsive team members: If a team member remains unresponsive after 24 hours, as a team we will re-delegate tasks to someone else so we wonâ€™t fall further behind. When the non-responsive team member becomes available, we are going to have a serious team discussion. If they are consistently non-response, we will inform a TA/Instructor about this
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personality Conflicts: If team members have an issue with each other, they can talk to a neutral third person to help solve the issues they have and learn to work with each other  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scared to ask for help: Let everyone know on the team that its ok to ask for help and that everyone is willing to help each other out. 



#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:
 * When and where? Recurring or ad hoc? In-person or online?
 * What's the purpose of each meeting?
 * Other events could be coding sessions, code reviews, quick weekly sync meeting online, etc.


#### Partner Meetings
You must have at least 2 meetings with your project partner - an initial planning meeting discussing the features you will build this iteration and a sprint demo meeting to review what you've done. Describe the meetings here:
* When and where will you meet?
* What do you intend to discuss(**note you will have meeting minutes in the review document**)?

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

 * Artifacts can be To-Do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
   * How do you prioritize tasks?
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members?


#### Deployment and Github Workflow

Describe your Git / GitHub workflow. Essentially, we want to understand how your team members shares a codebase, avoid conflicts and deploys the application.

  We've asked our TA to disable direct push to master, but we have not heard back yet. Since it is the beginning of the application, we have not experienced conflicts since we are all responsible 

 * Be concise, yet precise. For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 
 * Describe your overall deployment process from writing code to viewing a live applicatioon
 
 The mongoDB database, provided by our partners, is already deployed on heroku using mLab. With permission, we were able to directly use this database and create collections for our own use.
 Before actual deployment, all code is run and tested locally using "yarn start". The api is run on localhost port 7000, and the web app is run on localhost 3000. When we run both at the same time, the web app can be used.
 To be clear: the web app (liftovers-admin) connects to the api (liftovers-api), and the api connects to the mongo database which is already deployed on heroku.
 Once all parts of the code for part 2 is done, and the web app works locally, it will be deployed on heroku directly through git. More details of how it's used is explained below.
 
 * What deployment tool(s) are you using and why
 
 We are using heroku for deployment. 
 Reason #1: our partners are using heroku to deploy the mongo database and their old api.
 Reason #2: we can use heroku directly through git which is very convenient. Also, since we do need to deploy the api and web app separately, heroku allows us to do so by creating multiple heroku git remotes, and use different sub-folders for the different remotes. This way, it is easy to control and update separate deployments, and deployment history & log files can be accessed using the heroku account used for deployment. 
 
 * Don't forget to **explain why** you chose this workflow or particular aspects of it!



## Product

#### Goals and tasks (From most to least important)

 * On the webpages that display model information about volunteers and administrators, there should be functionality to display models in a table, annd create/delete models in a form by making GET, POST, and DELETE request to the api. 
 * Create the main functionality of the dashboard by displaying priority information such as: lifts with issues, lifts that need approval, and new volunteer accounts that need approval 
 * Create the sign up page with validation by creating certain requirements for each information field such as: alphanumeric characters only, must be exactly 6 characters... etc. 
 * Create the sign in page (no authentication)
 * Create mongoDB collections for volunteers, lifts and users. Connect the api to the database and create corresponding objects (i.e. models).
 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * Order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
