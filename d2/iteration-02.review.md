# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Nov 13, 2019
 * Where: Robarts 5th floor, Study Room 3 

## Process - Reflection

(Optional) Short introduction

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.
 * Team organization: we made an effort to isolate different areas so we could work without overlap or conflict. For example: Stacey worked on the dashboard, Andries worked on lift objects, Ryan and Tosin worked on the sign up/login, Faye worked on the volunteer create form, and Angela and Fillis worked on creating the database/deployment. This division helped us avoid conflicts in code. 
 * Group coding sessions: we had two group coding sessions which was really helpful in catching each other up on what we were doing as well as swapping problems for a new prespective when we were stuck on bugs/compile issues. This was a recent decision we made and seemed to streamline our progress quicker than before. 
 * Help from liftovers teach lead: Abu from liftovers is the teach lead and when we were stuck with making API requests to get user obejcts, we asked him for help and he was able to spot the problem quickly. This was a successful decision as instead of struggling with it ourselves in a language we weren't comfortable in, we reached out, described the problem and diagnosis, and he was able to propose a solution. Screenshot of chat here: ()

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * From most to least important. Say why they are important/not that important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.
 * Struggling to get started with unfamiliar code, as we chose to create a NodeJS React app 
 * Jumping too fast into creating forms, now we have to change the Sign Up and Create Volunteer form. 
 * Team roles not being fulfilled as planned
 
 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * From most to least important. Say why they are important/not that important.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).


#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)
 * Have regular group coding sessions so we can keep on task with our progress and provide help/support for each other immediately.
 
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:
 *  * Decision about models: Relationship between user and volunteer objects, where user has an attribute role which is either "admin, "volunteer", or "superAdmin". After having a conversation with liftovers' team lead, he really supported the decision and commended us on the industry standard we followed. 
 * From most to least important. Say why they are important/not that important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important. Say why they are important/not that important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

#### How was your product demo?
 * How did you prepare your demo?
 * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
 * Did your partner accept the features?
 * Were there change requests?
 * What did you learn from the demo from either a process or product perspective?

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.
